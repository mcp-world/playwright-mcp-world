# Playwright MCP World

## A Community-Driven Fork with Enhanced Features

This is a community-maintained fork of the [Microsoft Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) server that includes additional features and improvements requested by the community but not yet included in the original project.

### Why This Fork?

Our goal is to provide a feature-rich Playwright MCP server that includes capabilities the community needs but which may not align with the original project's scope or priorities. As noted in [this discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/pull/448#issuecomment-2892276410), some features may be better suited for community-maintained versions.

This fork serves as a testing ground for new features and a way to quickly deliver functionality that users need today.

### Merged Community Contributions

We've integrated features from several community forks:

- **[viktor-silakov/playwright-mcp-advanced](https://github.com/viktor-silakov/playwright-mcp-advanced)** - Enhanced screenshot tools, HTML extraction, and element snapshots
- **[nnamon/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/nnamon/playwright-mcp)** - JavaScript execution capabilities, Docker support, and improved build tooling
- **[Verto-FX/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/Verto-FX/playwright-mcp)** - Video recording capabilities (see [#546](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/546), [#547](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/pull/547))

### About Playwright MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.

### Key Features

- **Fast and lightweight**. Uses Playwright's accessibility tree, not pixel-based input.
- **LLM-friendly**. No vision models needed, operates purely on structured data.
- **Deterministic tool application**. Avoids ambiguity common with screenshot-based approaches.

### üöÄ Advanced Features

This version includes additional tools not available in the original Playwright MCP:

- **`browser_evaluate`** - Execute JavaScript code in the browser context
- **`browser_take_screenshot`** - Enhanced screenshot tool with fullPage and locator support
- **`browser_get_html_content`** - Extract HTML content from pages or specific elements
- **`browser_get_outer_html`** - Get complete element HTML including the element tag
- **`browser_element_snapshot`** - Capture accessibility snapshots of specific elements by locator
- **`get_video_path`** - Get the path to video recordings for browser sessions
- **`save_video`** - Save video recordings to the output directory with custom filenames
- **`list_video_files`** - List all video files in the output directory

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Notice

This project is currently experimental and may be unstable due to the nature of integrating features from multiple community forks. If you encounter any bugs or issues, please [file an issue](https://github.com/mcp-world/playwright-mcp-world/issues) on GitHub to help us improve.

### User profile

You can run Playwright MCP with persistent profile like a regular browser (default), or in the isolated contexts for the testing sessions.

**Persistent profile**

All the logged in information will be stored in the persistent profile, you can delete it between sessions if you'd like to clear the offline state.
Persistent profile is located at the following locations and you can override it with the `--user-data-dir` argument.

```bash
# Windows
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\mcp-{channel}-profile

# macOS
- ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/mcp-{channel}-profile

# Linux
- ~/.cache/ms-playwright/mcp-{channel}-profile
```

**Isolated**

In the isolated mode, each session is started in the isolated profile. Every time you ask MCP to close the browser,
the session is closed and all the storage state for this session is lost. You can provide initial storage state
to the browser via the config's `contextOptions` or via the `--storage-state` argument. Learn more about the storage
state [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth).

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@mcp-world/playwright-mcp-world@latest",
        "--isolated",
        "--storage-state={path/to/storage.json}"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration file

The Playwright MCP server can be configured using a JSON configuration file. You can specify the configuration file
using the `--config` command line option:

```bash
npx @mcp-world/playwright-mcp-world@latest --config path/to/config.json
```

<details>

### Standalone MCP server

When running headed browser on system w/o display or from worker processes of the IDEs,
run the MCP server from environment with the DISPLAY and pass the `--port` flag to enable SSE transport.

```bash
npx @mcp-world/playwright-mcp-world@latest --port 8931
```

And then in MCP client config, set the `url` to the SSE endpoint:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8931/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary><b>Docker</b></summary>

**NOTE:** The Docker implementation only supports headless chromium at the moment.

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--init", "--pull=always", "playwright-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can build the Docker image yourself.

```
docker build -t playwright-mcp .
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Programmatic usage</b></summary>

```js
import http from 'http';

import { createConnection } from '@mcp-world/playwright-mcp-world';
import { SSEServerTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/sse.js';

http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  // ...

  // Creates a headless Playwright MCP server with SSE transport
  const connection = await createConnection({ browser: { launchOptions: { headless: true } } });
  const transport = new SSEServerTransport('/messages', res);
  await connection.sever.connect(transport);

  // ...
});
```
</details>


### Tools

The tools are available in two modes:

1. **Snapshot Mode** (default): Uses accessibility snapshots for better performance and reliability
2. **Vision Mode**: Uses screenshots for visual-based interactions

To use Vision Mode, add the `--vision` flag when starting the server:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@mcp-world/playwright-mcp-world@latest",
        "--vision"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Vision Mode works best with the computer use models that are able to interact with elements using
X Y coordinate space, based on the provided screenshot.

**Note:** All HTML content extraction tools (`browser_get_html_content`, `browser_get_outer_html`) are also available in Vision Mode, providing the same functionality regardless of the mode used.
